Viper is a Decentralised Infrastructure Protocol (DePIN) that allows anyone to permissionlessly contribute compute and get rewarded for servicing RPC relays. Our global network of independent nodes provides web3 applications with a trustless blockchain interaction layer, unlocking the singular benefits of decentralisationâ€”enhanced security, speed, resiliency and cost savings. Viper incentivises optimal node performance through public "report cards" and dedicated monitoring. By optimising performance with incentives, we're streamlining decentralisation to make it accessible and catalyse web3's potential.
